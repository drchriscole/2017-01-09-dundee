# SPEAKER_NOTES.md - R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis

Speaker Notes for the 2017-01-11 Software Carpentry R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis lesson

**TYPE ALL EXAMPLES AS YOU GO. THIS KEEPS THE SPEED SANE, AND ALLOWS YOU TO EXPLAIN EVERY STEP.**

**START SLIDES WITH `reveal-md slides.md --theme=white`**

## Introduction to R and RStudio
  
**SLIDE** (Why `R`/`RStudio`?)
  
* Talk around slide

**SLIDE** ("But I already know Excel!")
  
**SLIDE** (`R`/`RStudio` presentation)

* Live presentation section
* Everyone start up `RStudio`

**Summarise windows**

* Four (maybe three) subwindows:
  * Interactive `R` console
  * Editor (may be missing on startup - will appear when files are opened)
  * Environment/History
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help
  
### Create a working directory with version control

* **We're following practices of project management**
  * We'll create a project directory, with `Git` version control
  * Helps ensure data integrity
  * Makes sharing code easier (lab-mates, publication)
  * Easier to recover after a Christmas break
  
* **Create the new directory LIVE**
  * `File->New Project`
  * `New Directory`
  * `Empty Project`
  * Enter sensible name, e.g. `swc-r_reproducible`
  * Check box for `Create a git repository`
  * `Create project`
  
![Red/green sticky](images/red_green_sticky.png)

* Describe contents of new folder
  * `.gitignore`
  * `.Rproj`
  
**SLIDE** (Best practices)

* Talk around slide

### Create directory structure

**SLIDE** (Creating files/directories)

* **LIVE PRESENTATION**
* **Create subdirectory for data**
  * In `Files` tab, create `data` subdirectory  
* **Create new `R` script**  
  * `File -> New File -> R script`
  * save in working directory with sensible name, e.g. `swc-script.R`
  
![Red/green sticky](images/red_green_sticky.png)

* **LIVE VERSION CONTROL EXAMPLE**
* **Show Git tab on right**
* **Stage files**
  * Three files shown (including `.gitignore` and the new script file)
  * Yellow status markers mean they're not in the repository
  * Click check-boxes to stage them
  * Note that **we don't version disposable output**
* **Commit files**
  * Click `Commit`
  * Describe new dialogue window
  * Show contents/changes to files
  * Add commit message ("initialise repository") - good commit messages are short and imperative
  * Commit
  * Show commit summary
  * Exit
  
![Red/green sticky](images/red_green_sticky.png)

**SLIDE** (Challenge 1)

Run through challenge (5min?) - hint about editing `.gitignore`

* Right-click link on presentation and download to `data`
* Create `graphs` subdirectory in `Files` tab
* Edit `.gitignore` to add `graphs/` folder and save
* Stage `.gitignore` in Git tab
* Commit in Git tab, and add appropriate commit message
* Demo History window for Git

**SLIDE** (`R` as a calculator)

### Interacting with `R`

* **Two ways**
  * Type commands in the console
  * Use the script editor and save the script  
* **Console**
  * Output shown here
  * Good for experimentation
  * Commands 'forgotten' when you close a session
* **Script**
  * Keeps record of what you did
  * Easier to reproduce and share
  
**Working at the console**

* `R` shows a `>` if it is expecting input

```
> 1 + 100
[1] 101
```

* `R` shows `+` if it's waiting for completion (`Esc` to exit)

```
> 1 +
+ 
```

**Working from script file**

* Can write same commands in the script file (`1 + 100`)
  * Use `Run` to execute
  * Use `Ctrl-Enter` to execute
  * Output appears in the console
  * Show `#` comments - good practice to comment
  * More examples (order of precedence):
  
```
> 3 + 5 * 2
[1] 13
> (3 + 5) * 2
[1] 16
```

* Show `Source` operation: add the following lines to script:

```
# Using R as a calculator script demo
1 + 100
3 + 5 * 2
(3 + 5) * 2
```

* Run script

```
> # Using R as a calculator script demo
> 1 + 100
[1] 101
> 3 + 5 * 2
[1] 13
> (3 + 5) * 2
[1] 16
```

* More examples
  * scientific notation

```
> 1/40
[1] 0.025
> 2/10000
[1] 2e-04
> 5e3
[1] 5000
```

### Mathematical functions

* General format: `fn(arg)`
  * autocompletion - example: `factorial(6)`

```
> sin(1)
[1] 0.841471
> log(1)
[1] 0
> log10(10)
[1] 1
> exp(0.5)
[1] 1.648721
```

### Comparisons

* Return `TRUE`/`FALSE` `logical` values

```
> 1 == 1
[1] TRUE
> 1 == 2
[1] FALSE
> 1 != 2
[1] TRUE
> 1 < 2
[1] TRUE
> 1 > 2
[1] FALSE
> 1 <= 2
[1] TRUE
> 1 >= 2
[1] FALSE
```

* Computer representation of numbers is approximate: important for comparisons
  * Any physicists/computer scientists in the room?
  * Numbers may not be equal, but be 'the same'
  * Use `all.equal` instead of `==`
  
```
> all.equal(pi-1e-7, pi)
[1] "Mean relative difference: 3.183099e-08"
> all.equal(pi-1e-8, pi)
[1] TRUE
> pi-1e-8 == pi
[1] FALSE
```

### Variables and assignment

* **Variables hold values**, just like in Python

* Two ways to assign variables: `<-` and `=`
  * The `<-` form is more widely used
  * Consistency more important than choice

```
> x <- 1/40
> x
[1] 0.025
> x = 1/40
> x
[1] 0.025
```

* **Look at the Environment tab** automatic updates

```
> x <- 100
```

* Variables can be used as arguments to functions

```
> log(x)
[1] 4.60517
> sqrt(x)
[1] 10
```

* Variables can be used to reassign values to themselves

```
> x
[1] 100
> x <- x + 1
> x
[1] 101
```

**SLIDE** (Good variable names)

* Talk around slide

**SLIDE** (MCQ1)

* Pose question

### Package management

**SLIDE** (Package Management)

* See what packages are installed with `installed.packages()`
  * **demo this one**
* Add a new package using `install.packages("packagename")`
  * **demo this one with** `install.packages("ggplot2")`
* Update packages with `update.packages()`
  * **demo this one**
* You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
* To make a package available for use, use `library(packagename)`
  * **demo**
  * Note that there are no quotes, this time

```
> ggplot()
Error: could not find function "ggplot"
> library(ggplot2)
Warning message:
package ‘ggplot2’ was built under R version 3.2.3 
> ggplot()
Warning message:
In max(vapply(evaled, length, integer(1))) :
  no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf
```

**SLIDE** (Challenge 2)

Solution:

```
install.packages("plyr")
install.packages("gapminder")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyr")
```

### Getting help for functions

**SLIDE** (Functions, and getting help)

* Talk around slide

* Demo: `round(3.14159)`:
  * argument: `3.14159`
  * value: `3`
  
```
> round(3.14159)
[1] 3
```  

**SLIDE** (Getting help for functions)

* **Carrying on with `round()` from last slide**

* What other arguments can `round()` take?
  * Use `args(fname)`
  
```
> args(round)
function (x, digits = 0) 
NULL
```

* Can use the `digits` argument by naming it, or not (but order matters)

```
> round(3.14159, digits=2)
[1] 3.14
> round(3.14159, 2)
[1] 3.14
```

* **Best practice**: always use the argument name
  * clearer to others
  * if function changes, order may change
  * difficult to remember the purpose of each argument, if not explicit
  
* **What does a function do?**
  * Use `?fname` or `help(fname)` to get the complete help text
  * Demo: `?round` - go through main points
  
* **What package is my function in?**
  * (i.e. I can't find it, and don't know what to install)
  * Demo: `??melt` - show that we need `reshape2`
  
* **Is there a function that does X?**
  * e.g. you know the name of a test, such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov
  * Demo: `help.search("smirnov")`, `?ks.test`

**SLIDE** (Where can I get more help?)

* Talk around slide

**SLIDE** (Asking the right questions)

* Talk around slide

* For `dput()` example use `dput(head(iris))`
* Demo `sessionInfo()`
